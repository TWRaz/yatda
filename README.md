#Getting Started
1. Get Node/NPM, I use NVM to manage it
2. Clone repo
3. Run `npm install` in the project folder, it should create a typings folder
4. Use `npm run` to run the app and get live changes synced to the browser

`npm test` will start up a test server to run tests against Chrome with a file watcher.

If you don't have IntelliJ Enterprise I recommend VSCode with TSLint and Angular 2 TypeScript Snippets

There are other good plugins too but those are pretty basic solid support.
